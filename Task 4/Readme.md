# 📧 Spam Mail Detection

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project aims to classify emails as **spam** or **ham** using **Machine Learning**. By leveraging **TF-IDF vectorization** and **Logistic Regression**, this model helps in filtering out spam emails effectively, improving email security and user experience.

## 📌 Features
- **Preprocessing**: Cleaned the dataset, removed duplicates, and handled missing values.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Transformed text data into numerical features.
- **Logistic Regression Model**: Trained to classify emails with high accuracy.
- **Spam vs Ham Analysis**: Visualized the distribution of spam and ham emails.
- **Real-time Prediction**: Implemented a way to classify new email messages.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Scikit-Learn** for machine learning modeling
- **Matplotlib** for data visualization
- **Pickle** for model saving and deployment

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of labeled email messages, categorized as spam or ham. It was preprocessed to ensure data quality before training the model.

## 🔄 Model Training & Evaluation
1. **Preprocessed text data** by removing unnecessary columns and handling missing values.
2. **Vectorized emails using TF-IDF** to extract important features.
3. **Trained a Logistic Regression model** on balanced data.
4. **Evaluated model performance** using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.
